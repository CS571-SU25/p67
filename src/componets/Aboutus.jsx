        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>The Black Men Collective was founded in Late May of 2024. The founding came as a
             result of need for Black men on campus to have a space for community. At the time the only way as a black man to have community was to seek 
             out other black men in black student orgs or join a fraternity. Our goal is to be that in between. As joining a frat can seem like a big commitment
             and being apart of a student org can also be seen as a hassle. On campus we look to be the provider of resourses as can be seen as the events we
             have hosted including Headshots and Haircuts. Our goal is to provide a comfortable space for black men to cultivate and grow at UW Madison.
